<pre>"It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters."

 This quote emphasizes the Stoic idea that we have control over our reactions and attitudes toward events in our lives, even if we can't always control the events themselves. It encourages us to focus on our inner responses and cultivate resilience and wisdom.</pre>
